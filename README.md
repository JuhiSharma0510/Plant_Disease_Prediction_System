# Plant_Disease_Prediction_System

**View Project** : https://plantdiseasepredictionsystem.streamlit.app/

This repository contains a Plant Disease Prediction System built using Deep Learning. The system identifies diseases in plant leaves based on uploaded images. It is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.This project aims to assist farmers and agricultural experts in diagnosing plant health efficiently.

**Features**<br>
-Deep Learning Model: Pre-trained TensorFlow/Keras model for classifying plant diseases.<br>
-User-Friendly Interface: Upload plant leaf images and get real-time predictions.<br>
-Plant Database: Includes disease information for plants like Apple, Blueberry, Cherry, Corn, and Tomato.<br>
